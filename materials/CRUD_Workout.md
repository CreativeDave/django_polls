# Python Shell CRUD Workout
> To be a proficient django developer, I should both be familiar with how data is created, read, updated, and deleted, and the syntax needed to perform these operations in the API. This workout is an extension of the official django tutorial's playing with the API section, but with added structure and less explanation. I was practicing this routine on my own, and only decided to compile it in case anybody else finished the tutorial and wanted some additional review.  

### Getting started

Complete the [django polls tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) using their naming system, or clone my version from the README.md. For these excercises, make sure the server is not running. CTRL + C to exit. 

#### PreWorkout
Navigate to the folder where the sqlite3.db is stored. On my project, this folder is 'mysite.'
